       //Okey but what is the goal of covariance??

       /**
        * Covariance is a concept that allows more specific subtypes
        * to be used in place of more general supertypes.
        * This can be especially useful when working with generic types,
        * making your code more flexible and user-friendly.
        * Here are some comments about the purpose and
        * benefits of covariance:
        */

       /**
        * 1. Greater General Use:
        * Covariance allows you to place a more specific type on top of
        * a more general type. This makes your code more flexible
        * and supports a wider range of types. This is particularly
        * important for data structures like collections.
        * For example, you can assign a 'List<Cat>' type to a
        * 'List<Pet>' type.
        */

       /**
        * 2. User-Friendly:
        * Covariance makes APIs easier to use, reducing the need
        * for type conversions and improving usability.
        * It helps in writing more concise and user-friendly code.
        */

       /**
        * 3. Reducing Pointer Problems:
        * Covariance reduces pointer problems, such as type
        * incompatibility. It leads to safer and error-free code.
        * It ensures that you can work with different subtypes of a
        * common supertype more seamlessly.
        */

       /**
        * While covariance is a powerful feature, it should be
        * used carefully, as misuse can lead to runtime errors.
        * Understanding type parameters and variance rules is
        * essential when working with covariance.
